        "The Vision Transformer lacks image-specific inductive biases such as translation equivariance and locality (except in MLP layers), which are inherent to CNNs throughout the whole model.",
        "ViT yields modest accuracies below ResNets on mid-sized datasets like ImageNet, but outperforms ResNets when trained on larger datasets (14M-300M images), showing that large scale training trumps inductive bias.",
        "The best model, ViT-H/14, achieved an accuracy of 88.55% on ImageNet.",
        "Similar to BERT, a learnable [class] token is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches, and its state at the output of the Transformer encoder serves as the image representation used for classification.",
        "ViT requires substantially fewer computational resources; for instance, ViT-L/16 took 0.68k TPUv3-core-days to pre-train on JFT-300M, while BiT-L took 9.9k.",
        "The authors observed no significant performance gains from using advanced 2D-aware position embeddings compared to standard learnable 1D position embeddings.",
        "In the hybrid architecture, the input sequence to the Transformer is formed from patches extracted from the feature maps of a CNN, rather than raw image patches.",
        "With self-supervised pre-training, the ViT-B/16 model achieved 79.9% accuracy on ImageNet, which is a significant improvement over training from scratch but still behind supervised pre-training."
